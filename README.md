![Usage counter](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?color=41BDF5&logo=home-assistant&label=integration%20usage&suffix=%20installs&cacheSeconds=15600&url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b12e/ha-lynkco-usage-stats/refs/heads/main/usage.json&query=$.total_usage) 

Custom [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) integration for Lynk & Co vehicles (>MY25 01, 02 and 08) via [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/).

If you like the integration, make sure to show your love by giving it a ⭐. 

This repository is a personal fork with additional vehicle sensors, diagnostics and
endpoint-failure handling. If you have any feature requests or issues, please
[create an issue](https://github.com/jeanbart82/ha_lynkco_2026/issues/new) using the template provided.

## Supported Models

Tested on the following vehicles:
- 2025 (New/Facelift) Lynk & Co 01 (PHEV) and newer
- Lynk & Co 02 (BEV)
- Lynk & Co 08 (PHEV)

Additional community testing shows that the integration can also work partially
with a pre-2025 Lynk & Co 01. See the [2023 Lynk & Co 01 test results](https://github.com/b12e/ha_lynkco_2025/issues/33).

Other models are currently not available on the EU market, although it is likely
when they do become available they are on the same platform and will work. The
documentation will be updated accordingly as soon as this happens.

> **Compatibility note**: Pre-2025 Lynk & Co 01 models use a different platform
> and are not officially supported. However, a 2023 Lynk & Co 01 was tested with
> this integration and several actions worked. Results may vary by vehicle,
> software version and API state. You can also try [this](https://github.com/Donkie/Hass-Lynk-Co) repo.

# Installation

## HACS (recommended)
[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=jeanbart82&repository=ha_lynkco_2026&category=integration)
1. Make sure [HACS](https://hacs.xyz) is installed in your Home Assistant installation
2. In HACS, add `https://github.com/jeanbart82/ha_lynkco_2026` as a **Custom repository** of type **Integration**, then download it.
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. Go to Settings → Devices & services → + Add Integration → Lynk & Co

## Manual
Copy `custom_components/lynkco/` to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory.

# Setup

The integration uses Azure AD B2C authentication with MFA in the same way the mobile app uses it. Setup requires a one-time browser login:

1. Add the integration in Home Assistant
2. A login URL is generated - open it in your browser
3. Open DevTools (F12) → Network tab
4. Log in with your Lynk & Co email + password + SMS MFA code
5. After MFA, the browser will fail to open `msauth://...`
6. In the network tab of your developer tools, find the last request → copy the `Location` header value (note: Firefox dev tools don't show the entire header. Right click on the request and copy the response headers instead, and then get the `msauth://` header from there)
7. Paste the full `msauth://...` URL back in Home Assistant

This process should be similar to the HACS integration for pre-2025 Lynk&Co cars such as the [Donkie](https://github.com/Donkie/Hass-Lynk-Co) one. 

Tokens are automatically refreshed. You should only need to re-authenticate if the refresh token expires (e.g. if your Home Assistant instance has been offline for an extended period of time, or when you log in on the mobile app).

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Lynk&Co only allows 1 device to be logged in to the app at all times. This sadly also means that, when you log in to Home Assistant, your mobile app will automatically be logged out and vice versa. The workaround is to create a Home Assistant dashboard that replaces the Lynk&Co mobile app.
- There is evidence in the mobile app source code that Lynk&Co is working on a way to add multiple 'drivers' to the same vehicle - each using their own Lynk&Co account. Whether or not there's implications for this HACS integration is yet to be found out, but it appears that in the future you would be able to use the mobile app and HA integration simultaneously by creating a dedicated account for either HA or mobile app usage.

### Binary Sensors
| Entity | Device class | Model Availability |
|---|---|---|
| Front left door | door | All |
| Front right door | door | All |
| Rear left door | door | All |
| Rear right door | door | All |
| Front left window | window | All |

| Doors and windows closed | door | All |
| Car running | running | All |
| Telematics enabled | - | All |
| Location data enabled | - | All |
| Location sharing enabled | - | All |
| Honking permitted | - | All |
| Flashing permitted | - | All |
| Charging data accurate | - | All |
| Climate target configurable | - | All |
| Climate usage limited | - | All |
| Engine started for low battery | - | PHEV |
| Engine started when climate active | - | PHEV |

Some binary sensors intentionally show `unknown` when the vehicle or API does
not provide the corresponding field. For example, a charge lid can be unknown
even when the tank flap correctly reports `closed`; unknown is not interpreted
as closed.

### Device Tracker
- GPS location with coordinates

### Lock
- Door lock / unlock
- Glovebox lock (requires PIN) / unlock

### Switch
- Charging - start/stop charging (on when the car reports it is charging)

### Climate
- Air conditioning - turn on/off and set the target temperature (16–28 °C). On PHEV models, starting the climate can start the engine to heat/cool the cabin. Reads as off while the car blocks it (e.g. unlocked or being driven).

### Button
- Refresh data - force an immediate refresh of all sensors from the device page
- Update location - ask the car to report its current GPS location

### Device information and availability
- Vehicle metadata is shared through the Home Assistant device information, including the model year and propulsion type when available.
- API endpoints are refreshed independently. If one endpoint fails, the last known values from the other endpoints remain available.
- Entities that depend on a failed endpoint become unavailable until that endpoint succeeds again.
- The diagnostic sensors expose the current API health and failed endpoint names.

## Compatibility test: 2023 Lynk & Co 01

The integration was tested on a **2023 Lynk & Co 01** using Home Assistant
2026.9 and integration version `v0.6.1`. The test was performed on
8 September 2026. The complete report is available in
[b12e/ha_lynkco_2025#33](https://github.com/b12e/ha_lynkco_2025/issues/33).

### Tested actions

| Action | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `lynkco.refresh` | ❌ Not confirmed | No visible effect during the test |
| `lynkco.request_location` | ❌ Not confirmed | The car was away during the test |
| `lynkco.lock_door` | ✅ Works |  |
| `lynkco.unlock_door` | ✅ Works |  |
| `lynkco.flash_lights` | ✅ Works |  |
| `lynkco.honk_horn` | ✅ Works |  |
| `lynkco.open_sunroof` | ❌ Not confirmed |  |
| `lynkco.close_sunroof` | ❌ Not confirmed |  |
| `lynkco.set_charge_limit` | ❌ No effect observed |  |
| `lynkco.start_charging` | ❌ Not tested | Charging was controlled separately with a one-phase charger |
| `lynkco.stop_charging` | ❌ No response observed | Tested while charging |
| `lynkco.start_conditioning` | ✅ Works | Response was somewhat slow and used the last temperature set in the car |
| `lynkco.stop_conditioning` | ✅ Works | Response was somewhat slow |
| `lynkco.start_ventilate` | ❌ Not tested |  |
| `lynkco.stop_ventilate` | ❌ Not tested |  |
| `lynkco.start_heaters` | ❌ No effect observed | Separate heater action did not appear necessary for conditioning |
| `lynkco.stop_heaters` | ❌ Not confirmed |  |
| `lynkco.lock_glovebox` | ❌ Not confirmed |  |
| `lynkco.unlock_glovebox` | ❌ Not confirmed |  |

The test also showed that entities did not all update consistently: some
appeared to update approximately every 15 minutes while others did not update
during the test. This is a preliminary result and should not be interpreted as
full support for all pre-2025 vehicles.

## Actions (Services)

#### Help needed
⚠️ Please open an issue if you have verified a feature works which is marked as t.b.c. in this table so I can update the readme as confirmed working/not working.

#### Notes:
- ✅ = confirmed working on that model<br />
- Sunroof actions aren't available on the Lynk&Co 02 as it doesn't have a sunroof that can open.<br />
- A lot of the actions are only available when the doors are locked and the key is not in the vehicle.
- The gloveblox locking/unlocking appears to be only possible while the vehicle is unlocked (needs confirmation). The Lynk&Co API accepts the action when the vehicle is locked, but the glovebox doesn't appear to be locking/unlocking when it is.
- `temp` is in ºC.
- `heaters` accepts a list of zones (see table below)


#### Heater zones
**Note:** Heaters require the climate system to be active first (use `start_conditioning` before `start_heaters`).

| Zone | 01 | 02 | 08 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `front_left_seat` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `front_right_seat` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `rear_left_seat` | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ * |
| `rear_right_seat` | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ * |
| `steering_wheel` | ✅ * | ✅ *| ✅ * |
| `defrost` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

⚠️ Zones marked with an asterisk (*) are only available on the More-models. The Core models are not equipped with these heating locations. This integration doesn't magically equip your vehicle with extra hardware :) 

</details> 

# Polling

The full vehicle data is polled every 15 minutes by default. On top of that, only endpoints relevant to what's happening are fast-polled (about every 60 seconds), instead of refetching everything:
- **While driving:** location, drive state and battery. The final location is fetched once when you reach your destination (on LynkOS 1.4.0+ the car only reports location when it stops if you've granted permission to do so in Settings -> System -> Privacy on your infotainment screen).
- **While the climate/conditioning system is active:** the climate state.

When you perform an action (e.g. lock the doors or start the heaters), only the relevant data is refreshed - not everything. The integration checks for a state change after 3 seconds, and if the car hasn't processed the command yet, retries after 5 and then 10 seconds before giving up. Fire-and-forget actions like flashing the lights or honking the horn don't trigger a refresh at all.

Custom polling intervals can be configured using the gear icon after setting up the integration, however as to protect Lynk&Co's infrastructure, the default intervals are also the minimum intervals. Only longer intervals can be configured.
